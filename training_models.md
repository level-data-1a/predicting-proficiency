# architectures
- linear / logistic regression (maya)
- decision tree / random forest (lmm)
- gradient boosted trees (manjari)

## to do
- generally try binary and continuous (`proficient_score`, `proficient_diff`) but architecture can only support one type do that
- focus on feature selection using non encoded dataframes (act\*_11, scantron\*_38)
- feature importance
- please document your code really really well! explain every step such that someone could understand it easily and add on

**Issues:**
- @LMM, for Features column, could you just list if you included courses, vendors, schools, or past proficiency? I assume you used courses but couldn't see the others so I didn't want to assume. - allison
