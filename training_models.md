## to do
- generally try binary and continuous (`proficient_score`, `proficient_diff`) but architecture can only support one type do that
- focus on feature selection using non encoded dataframes (act\*_11, scantron\*_38)
- feature importance
- please document your code really really well! explain every step such that someone could understand it easily and add on
