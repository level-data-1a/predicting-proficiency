# architectures
- linear / logistic regression (maya)
- decision tree / random forest (lmm)
- gradient boosted trees (manjari)

## to do
- generally try binary and continuous (`proficient_score`, `proficient_diff`) but architecture can only support one type do that
- focus on feature selection using non encoded dataframes (act\*_11, scantron\*_38)
- feature importance
