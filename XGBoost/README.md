- Any file ending with 'binary' has the label of 'is_proficient' (i.e., a binary label)
  - All files with that label use the same dataset as their continuous counterpart.
    The only difference is that it is a classification model, rather than a regression model.
  - Any binary model calculates:
    - F1
    - Accuracy
    - A confusion matrix
